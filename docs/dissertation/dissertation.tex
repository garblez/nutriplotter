\section{Introduction}

This paper presents a case study of the project undertook by Team CS25 of the Universty of Glasgow's 3rd year team project module. Our client for this project was the School of Medicine, Dentistry and Nursing and the aim was to design a game that helped teach users about healthy nutrition.

This paper will describe the progress and development of our system as well as going into the area's of agile development that we found effective, the difficulties we encountered and what we learned from overcoming them.

The rest of the case study is structured as follows:

\ref{sec:background} presents the background of the case study discussed, describing the customer and project context, aims, objectives and project state at the time of writing. 

\ref{sec:participation} is a brief section on how the project was influenced by some team members not participating for certain periods.

\ref{sec:agile} explains the way we set up the team roles at the beginning of development and how these roles evolved during the projects lifetime. We also go into the agile techniques used and their effectiveness.

\ref{sec:development} details the progress we made through the year, the features that were added or cut from final product and the reasons for these changes, obstacles during development and what the result of these was.

\ref{sec:conclusions} outlines the lessons that can be taken from the project and this case study.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

Explain the wider lessons that you learned about software engineering,
based on the specific issues discussed in previous sections.  Reflect
on the extent to which these lessons could be generalised to other
types of software project.  Relate the wider lessons to others
reported in case studies in the software engineering literature.
