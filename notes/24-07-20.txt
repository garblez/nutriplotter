Questions

-when submitting a plate with nothing on it, still have some score because some nutrients
only require less than a certain amount - should we change this?

Todo:
*-On food edit modal, keep the "back to plate" text on screen all the time
*-Change sliders in food edit modal so that they don't have an upper cap, and instead increase/decrease weight based on how far along the slider it is being dragged
*-Remake score screen so that all nutrients are left aligned, and make the nutrient levels black and (perhaps) bold
*-Add a score breakdown for each nutrient (i.e. how highly they scored for each nutrient out of 100)
-Change a few icons (e.g. veg and meat) to include a variety of foods e.g. for meat use chicken, beef, lamb.
*-Try pie chart full size and thinner (like old style)
*-On score screen add icon for each nutrient that links to the website in the email
